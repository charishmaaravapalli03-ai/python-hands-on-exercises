    "Object-Oriented Programming – Class and Inheritance\n",

    "Objective:\n",
    "To demonstrate the use of object-oriented programming concepts in Python by creating a base class and a subclass that inherits properties and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Description:\n",
    "This program illustrates class creation, inheritance, and method overriding in Python.\n",
    "A base class Vehicle is defined with common attributes make and model.\n",
    "A subclass Car inherits from Vehicle and introduces an additional attribute num_doors.\n",
    "The subclass also defines a method display_info() that prints all attributes, showing the concept of reusability through inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a base class Vehicle with attributes make and model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a subclass Car that inherits from Vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a new attribute num_doors to the Car class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use super().__init__() to call the constructor of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a method display_info() in the subclass to print all attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an object of the Car class and call display_info().\n",
    "\n",
    "End the program."
